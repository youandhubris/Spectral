My first experiment with openFrameworks. A basic audio visualizer using the [ofxPostProcessing](http://www.neilmendoza.com/ofxpostprocessing/) add-on, for live performance.  

Based on the "atomic fingerprint". Music as sculpture, removing from the silence. Music by [Tiago Sousa](http://tiagosousa.org): "Walden Pond’s Monk I" from the album "Walden Pond’s Monk", 2011. [Immune Recordings](http://immunerecordings.net/catalog/walden-ponds-monk/). [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/br/album/walden-ponds-monk/id441421450).  

This program was possible thanks to Denis Perevalov's [Mastering openFrameworks ](http://masteringof.wordpress.com). Check the video at [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/93052927).
